# Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction

Predict the completion status ("Completed" or "Not Completed") of clinical trials using structured and unstructured data such as study design, criteria, adverse events, and more. This project was developed for the Novartis Hackathon and leverages an ensemble of Random Forest and BioBERT models for robust predictions.

## Overview
Clinical trials generate large amounts of structured and unstructured data. Predicting whether a trial will be completed is valuable for sponsors, researchers, and regulatory bodies. This project combines tabular features and text embeddings to make accurate predictions using:
- **Random Forest Classifier** for structured features
- **BioBERT** for unstructured text features
- **Ensemble** for final prediction

## Features
- Predict trial completion status from CSV or manual entry
- FastAPI backend for scalable inference
- Streamlit frontend for interactive UI
- Preprocessing pipeline for both tabular and text data
- Downloadable predictions

## Architecture
- **Backend:** FastAPI (REST API), model loading, inference
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (CSV upload, manual entry, results visualization)
- **Models:** Random Forest, BioBERT (Hugging Face), ensemble logic
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaning, encoding, scaling, text embedding

## Setup & Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
	```powershell
	git clone https://github.com/Harsh-IITG/Clinical-Trial-Outcome-Prediction.git
	cd Clinical-Trial-Outcome-Prediction-main
	```
2. **Install dependencies:**
	```powershell
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
3. **Download models:**
	Models are automatically downloaded from Hugging Face Hub on first run.

## Usage
### Run Backend (API)
```powershell
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### Run Frontend (Streamlit)
```powershell
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py
```
